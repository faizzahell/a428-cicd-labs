The following "npm" command (if executed) installs the "cross-env"
dependency into the local "node_modules" directory, which will ultimately
be stored in the Jenkins home directory. As described in
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install, the "--save-dev" flag causes the
"cross-env" dependency to be installed as "devDependencies". For the
purposes of this tutorial, this flag is not important. However, when
installing this dependency, it would typically be done so using this
flag. For a comprehensive explanation about "devDependencies", see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies.

The following "npm" command tests that your simple Node.js/React
application renders satisfactorily. This command actually invokes the test
runner Jest (https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
+ npm test

> my-app@0.1.0 test
> react-scripts test --env=jsdom

PASS src/App.test.js

Ran all test suites.
Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
[0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich
is not maintianed anymore[0;33m. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.[0m

The following "npm" command builds your Node.js/React application for
production in the local "build" directory (i.e. within the
"/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-node-js-react-app" directory),
correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for
the best performance.

The following "npm" command runs your Node.js/React application in
development mode and makes the application available for web browsing.
The "npm start" command has a trailing ampersand so that the command runs
as a background process (i.e. asynchronously). Otherwise, this command
can pause running builds of CI/CD applications indefinitely. "npm start"
is followed by another command that retrieves the process ID (PID) value
of the previously run process (i.e. "npm start") and writes this value to
the file ".pidfile".
+ sleep 1
+ npm start

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your Node.js/React application in action.
(This is why you specified the "args -p 3000:3000" parameter when you
created your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile.)
[Pipeline] sh
+ ./jenkins/scripts/kill.sh
The following command terminates the "npm start" process using its PID
(written to ".pidfile"), all of which were conducted when "deliver.sh"
was executed.
